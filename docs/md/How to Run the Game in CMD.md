# How to Run the Game From Command Line?

1. Firstly, you have to download the game. [Link]()

2. Extract the zip in anywhere you like, such as `C:\Desktop\snake`
3. Diffrent from running game via exe, you have to **set the Path** environment variable, if you want to run it in console by typing command `snake`.

## Set the Path

See the tutorial below to learn how to set the path variable on Windows 10.

[[Add Path to Environment Variables](https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/features/test-runners/add-path-environment-variables#add-path-to-environment-variables)]

The path you need to add is 

```
[where you put extracted folder]\[game folder name]\bin
e.g.
C:\Desktop\snake0.9\bin
```

## Run the game from cmd

If the path is correctly set, you can open a console(cmd or powershell),  type the command `snake`, then you will see the game show up.

**The recommand console size is 120*30.** Window that is smaller than recommanded size will cause the content of the game cropped.
